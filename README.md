### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Abdelrahman, an IT-Security student with a passion for machine learning, I enjoy creating innvovative and efficient machine learning models and other projects using APIs and while my GitHub account may be a bit empty at the moment, that doesn't mean I'm not brimming with ideas and enthusiasm for the projects to come.
In the meantime, why not connect with me and let's chat about all things tech, football, and Movies? Who knows, maybe we'll come up with something even better than what I have planned. The possibilities are endless when you have a mind full of ideas and a heart full of humor.ðŸ‘½

- ðŸŽ¥ I enjoy watching Movies and series 
- ðŸ”´ Supporting Liverpool
